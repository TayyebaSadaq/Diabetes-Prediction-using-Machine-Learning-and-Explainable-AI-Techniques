# Diabetes Prediction using ML and XAI

## Overview
This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to predict diabetes and provide insights into the predictions. It includes multiple ML models and a user-friendly frontend for interaction. The app aims to assist users in understanding their health better and provide tailored advice based on their diagnosis.
